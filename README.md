## Fillout Assessment

Hi there! Thanks for taking the time to check out my implementation of the Fillout Assessment!

While building this project, I used the opportunity to explore a few technologies that were new or unfamiliar to me. For instance, I've always leaned on Redux for state management in my professional work, so this was my first real dive into React Context. It was a great chance to get hands-on with it and see how it compares.

### ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

* **Vite** â€“ My first time using it, and Iâ€™m impressed with how fast and lightweight it is.
* **React** â€“ My go-to frontend framework.
* **TypeScript** â€“ For type safety and better developer tooling.
* **TailwindCSS** â€“ For utility-first styling and rapid UI development.
* **Ant Design** â€“ I typically use Bootstrap, but decided to try Ant Design since it's used on Filloutâ€™s own site. It came in handy for buttons, popovers, and other UI elements.
* **React Icons** â€“ For clean, scalable icons.
* **DND-Kit** â€“ Iâ€™ve used this before, but it was a good refresher on drag-and-drop interactions.

Overall I actually enjoyed this project! I had a bit of difficulty with the DND boilerplate, but it gave me a lot to think about.
